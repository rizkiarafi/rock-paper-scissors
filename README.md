Rock Paper Scissors is a simple browser-based game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and state management without using any external libraries or frameworks. Players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, the computer generates a random choice, and the winner is determined using standard game rules. The game updates the UI dynamically to display results, scores, and choices in real time.

This project is suitable for beginners who want to understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, how to structure simple game logic, and how to manage user input and program state. It can be used as a learning project, practice project, or starter template for more advanced browser games.

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a browser. No installation, build tools, or dependencies are required. All logic is handled directly in JavaScript.

Game rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and computer choose the same option, the result is a draw.
